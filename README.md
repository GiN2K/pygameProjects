Some Games that I made using the pygame module

## [**Game 1 :** Space Invaders](https://github.com/GiN2K/pygameProjects/tree/main/Space%20Invaders)
Very simple game where you should shoot the moving enemies with your airplane

Killing an enemy will increase your score and the respawned enemy will be faster
